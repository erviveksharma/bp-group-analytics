Pie charts for xprofile fields.

== Description ==
Due to the presence of large number of groups and members, it becomes difficult to manage and procure relevant information about them. BP group analytics plugin helps solves this problem by providing an overview of the group members by using their xprofile fields.
This plugin helps to understand the relevant information easily through its graphical representation.

== Notes ==

Step 1:- Install the plugin and go to plugin settings in WordPress dashboard.

Step 2:- All xprofile fields are listed in the admin settings page. Select the xprofile fields for which chart is required and save settings

Step 3:- A new analytics tab will be added on groups single page, with pie charts by the profile fields selected in admin settings.
